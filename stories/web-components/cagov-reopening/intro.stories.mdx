# `CAGovReopening` Web Component Redesign

---DRAFT--- 
Still organizing these notes & figuring out the audience / level of detail.

<div className="content">

* Version: 2.0.0
* Status: Prototype / Draft

## Goal
Make it easier to find current guidance about how Californians can stay safe in their activities and businesses.

## Parts
1. Create a data & communication system to power an improved API to help publish & track State guidance about how Californians can stay safe in their activities and businesses.
2. Update the interface to the search tool we provide to help Californians find their guidance. In our user research, we learned that many businesses were struggling to find the guidance they needed, and we have prepared some new designs for improving how the search interface works.


### Page history
Started initially as a "What's Open" page, with statuses of business being "Open" or "Closed" by the Covid-19 web response team, part of the State of California's Office of Digital Innovation.

Over the course of the pandemic, the page has evolved to include search for businesses and activities, tier modifications, maps, supplementary industry guidance, and information about the Regional Stay at Home order.
