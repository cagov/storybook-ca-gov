### covid19-industry-guidance-categories
Key database showing current industry guidance categories. Used to keep track of which categories have moved. For example, over the course of the response to COVID-19, the guidance category for restaurants has evolved from being its own guidance category, to having special recommendations for take-out and dine-in restaurants, shifting guidance for venues with eateries, and more recently merging guidance with wineries and bars. This list of current categories is used to relate guidance categories.

### Page that will be updated: `https://covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy`
: "What's open" page. Other names: "Safer Economy", "Roadmap", "Dimmer switch", "Blueprint"

### Page history
Started initially as a "What's Open" page, with statuses of business being "Open" or "Closed" by the Covid-19 web response team, part of the State of California's Office of Digital Innovation.

Over the course of the pandemic, the page has evolved to include search for businesses and activities, tier modifications, maps, supplementary industry guidance, and information about the Regional Stay at Home order.

## Other notes about documenting this data set

### API template with emergency data documentation
Information is data in context. To help build shared understanding of what's going on with changes in the response to COVID-19, the covid19.ca.gov response team pulls information from many sources, including very new data sets. Since we are responding quickly, but still need to keep track of our data sources, we noticed that we needed an easy way to keep track of that information. For this dataset, we are prototyping an emergency data documentation template, based on the CA Open Data portal handbook and some other metadata and data dictionary recommendations.

### Content Design API and example data sets
User feedback, research, accessibility and design are key factors in how the Office of Digital innovation approaches delivering information to those who need it. Part of this process includes prototyping our interfaces with realistic datasets, and testing that data in our Storybook web-component tool. 

To help streamline this process & get the best designs out the door, we are exploring sharing a Content Design API, with realistic mock data, in multiple languages. This information can be fed into design and testing tools such as [Figma](https://figma.com) using [JSON to Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789839703871161985/JSON-to-Figma).

### Data backend & fall back process
We created an Airtable database that helps us update and keep track of publishing the continuously evolving COVID-19 industry guidance recommendations. We use the Airtable database to build and publish publish a JSON file that we can write to our `covid-static` file server when we launch, and we will provide the tables as CSV files to our WordPress instance that runs covid19.ca.gov as a fallback method in the event of a service outage where we cannot publish API updates from Airtable to Github.

CSV files from Airtable will be generated as part of a new automations workflow and suite of tools that have been outlined as part of our Phase 1, in which we made our dataset more structured and connected to collaborative tools to increase transparency and visibility across agencies.

## Data documentation and content modelling
While some Storybook components might be simple examples with button labels, other web components may be used to render real data, or be part of prototyping a design for a feature with more complexity. 

In order to build the component, it's necessary to grab samples of data to pass into the components. Designers normally use filler "dummy" text for some examples (i.e. "Lorem ipsum"). It's often the case that anyone reviewing a design with filler text will reach a limit in what they can visualize, before they need to see it in action.

Designers use tools such as [Framer](https://www.framer.com/), [Figma](https://www.figma.com/), [Invision](https://www.invisionapp.com/), [AdobeXD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd/pricing/individual.html) to show some prototypes. 

Tools such as [JSON to Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/789839703871161985) can help designers to pull data into their prototypes. Similarly, Storybook stories can pull data or copies of data for rendering the web-component, and building data to support rendering variations of the stories.

For charts and other data, using a clear example from a point in time that's clearly indicated can also help. For our work with covid19.ca.gov, we learned that it could be helpful to see a chart with "real data", and also to help point anyone who wants to know more about the data source. Developers also need this information for building and debugging their tools.
