## Redesign Phases

1. Create a data & communication system to power an improved API to help publish & track State guidance about how Californians can stay safe in their activities and businesses.
2. Document lessons learned.
3. Update the interface to the search tool we provide to help Californians find their guidance. In our user research, we learned that many businesses were struggling to find the guidance they needed, and we have prepared some new designs for improving how the search interface works.
