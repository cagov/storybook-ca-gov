# API Notebook for Reopening Roadmap Activity Data

Our front-end redesign for the `/industry-guidance` is a compilation of activity and business data sets and associated guidance files.

This `api-workbook` folder shows how we are documenting a compilation of data from different sources and improving data documentation.

## Documentation
IN PROGRESS - We are documenting the data in a structured way.

## Update JSON data
Build or update JSON Data set from Airtable & generate JSON object for state industry guidance
TIP: If making quick edits, "Sync" the Airtable API base
* `npm run build:data:cagov-reopening`

## Automations & Publishing

We have several automation & publishing tools planned
