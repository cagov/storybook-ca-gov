# API data for Reopening Roadmap Activity

Our front-end redesign for the `/industry-guidance` and `/safer-economy` use a compilation of activity and business data sets and associated guidance files.

This `api-workbook` folder shows how we are documenting a compilation of data from different sources and improving data documentation.

## Documentation
See [Data documentation](./DATA_DOCS.md)

This component also includes a `data-packages.json` as an example of how to implement documentation for multiple data sets.

## Update API

Manual process
* `npm run build:data:cagov-reopening` — Build or update JSON Data set from Airtable & generate JSON object for state industry guidance
* TIP: If making quick edits, "Sync" the Airtable API base
