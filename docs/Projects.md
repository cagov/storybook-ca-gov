## Projects

These projects come from our current covid19.ca.gov team projects:

* Updating the `covid19.ca.gov/safer-economy` search component to use a new data source & initiate a redesign effort.
* Convert d3 charts from `covid19.ca.gov/equity` into reusable components & use this tool as a reference for teaching how to generate performant, accessible & translatable SVG-based interactive charts using d3.

### covid19.ca.gov

* `cagov-accordion` — A re-usable, accessible, performant accordion component.
* `cagov-reopening` — An prototype of an interface for the covid19.ca.gov page.

### d3 Charts

Performant, translatable & accessible charts with d3.js

* `hello-chart` — A simple instance of d3 code in a web component.
* `cagov-county-map` — A web component for a fully configured chart with county regions highlighted, multilingual datasets and chart labels.
